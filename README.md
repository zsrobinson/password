# Password Utilities

Visit project: https://zsrobinson.github.io/passwordUtilities

This is just a simple password generator to help people create stronger passwords for their accounts. This project uses the open source [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) library to evaluate the strength of generated passwords. It also uses the CSS Framework [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). I plan to add a page to check the strength of your existing passwords, as well as a way to create pass phrases that are made up of random words as opposed to random characters. Word lists from zxcvbn and [first20hours/google-10000-english on GitHub](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english).
